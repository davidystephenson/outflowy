> The UI displays the recursive hierarchy with nested bullet points, embedding the name as HTML.
> Below the bullet points are three buttons, Reject, Concern, and Accept.
> If the user clicks the Reject button, the displayed node is moved to the node with the Rejected Node ID.
> If the user clicks the Concern button, the displayed node is moved to the node with the Concerned Node ID.
> If the user clicks the Accept button, the displayed node is moved to the node with the Accepted Node ID.
> After any of these buttons are clicked, a new random incomplete direct child of the node with the Source ID is displayed.
> If any of the target nodes does not exist, the UI alerts an error explaining the issue.
> While any button operation is ongoing, all buttons and the form should be disabled.
